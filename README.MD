# Coding task for Beyonnex Backend Devs

## The task
Write an interactive Java program that provides these 2 features:

1 - Checks if two texts are anagrams of each other. <br>
2 - Out of all inputs to feature #1: provides all the anagrams for a given string. Inputs to feature #1 do not need to persisted across multiple runs of your program.<br>

The mode of interactivity is not important. Choose what's easiest and quickest for you, a simple CLI interface is enough.

For feature #1:<br>
Please follow the definition described in the english wikipedia page for anagram.

For feature #2:<br>

    Given these hypothetical invocations of the feature#1 function -> f1(A, B), f1(A, C), f1(A, D)
    IF A, B and D are anagrams
    f2(A) should return [B, D]
    f2(B) should return [A, D]
    f2(C) should return []

Feel free to use your favorite:

    IDE
    Language; the solution has to be either Java 8+ or Kotlin
    code hosting; the solution must be publicly accessible
    You can prioritize however you like (performance, readability, extensibility, ...).

P.S. Googling is a good thing :-)
